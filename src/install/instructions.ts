- Use transfer_work for assignment, acceptance, decline, release, reassignment, evidence-bearing handoff offers, and reopening.
- Call finish_work before finishing, review, or closure with changed files, tests, assumptions, decisions, risks, and provenance.

<!-- concord:workflow-version=${CONCORD_INSTRUCTION_VERSION} -->

This project uses Concord MCP. Keep coordination to the five workflow tools:

- **Before editing**, call \`start_work\` with the task, your agent kind, and
  expected files or modules. It registers presence, accepts assigned work when
  appropriate, claims the scope, and returns overlap warnings. Concord derives
  your \`agent_id\` from your session — omit it unless your client told you one.
- Use \`inspect_work\` to read the workspace, one task, one agent, or one message
  thread. Use \`update_work\` for durable progress and for live prompts/replies
  to another promptable workspace agent, including while that agent is busy.
- Use \`transfer_work\` for assignment, acceptance, decline, release,
  reassignment, evidence-bearing handoff offers, and reopening.
- **Before finishing**, call \`finish_work\` once with the outcome, changed
  files, tests, assumptions, decisions, risks, guardrails, and provenance. It
  records evidence and can mark work review-ready or terminal.

Keep each claim small and resolve reported overlaps before editing. Concord
regenerates human-readable review artifacts in \`.concord/\`.

Enforcement remains client-dependent. \`concord doctor\` reports setup and
workflow adoption; optional hooks can block exact-file collisions.
